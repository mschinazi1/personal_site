            <p> I am looking for the opportunity to jumpstart my career after my graduation in 2026.
                Since I was a child I have always had a curiosity for how our technology functions. I knew that I wanted to pursue Computer Engineering
                after taking Digital Electronics and some software classes in High School, leading me to the University of California Irvine. 
                Being from Greater Boston and living minutes away from the city my whole life, it has been a great challenge to embark on this West Coast
                journey on my own. This transition has led me to explore new ideas and engage in the UCI community to grow as a person and an engineer.
                Outside of classes, I have participated in IEEE at UCI's Open Project Space, learning more about embedded electronics and Arduino projects. 
                I have also joined the board for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers at UCI, serving as the Fundraising Chair. I hope to 
                represent this national organization well at the National Conference this fall, meeting fellow Hispanic engineers in STEM. I wrote this 
                website using HTML and CSS to further my Front-End Development skills and expand my knowledge past what I have learned in university. 
                Thank you for visiting my website!
